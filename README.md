In this project, I am building a vertical slider.
I have an image on the right side and some text on the left side. 
This can be any sort of content you like.
There are two arrows. When you click the up, one side goes up, the other side goes down. 
But it brings into place the correct text area and the correct image.
You go up and up again. I have four different slides.
If you click up again, it goes back to the beginning. Same with the down, just reversed.
